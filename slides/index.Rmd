# Research Question

### Basically, I have no theoretical stand or support, SORRY!
<br>
### But it comes from a phenomenon, in which a bilingual speaker's **second language** affects their **mother tongue**.
<br>
### In a certain language (**Kazakh** here), is the **vowel** pronunciation of speakers of this language affected if the speaker is **bilingually** proficient in another language (**Mandarin** here), compared to that of **monolingual** speakers?

# Hypotheses

###**H0**: There is **no difference** between vowels of monolingual and bilingual speakers.
<br>
###**H1**: Vowels of bilingual speakers will be **assimilated** to those in their second language compared to monolingual speakers.

## We should have sub-hypotheses as well:

###**H1a**: The vowel [i] of bilingual speakers is higher/more front than that of monolingual speakers.

#Data

### All data were collected previously (3 years ago) for Merlin's Master Thesis. I have never properly used this dataset.

### Every participant were asked to pronounce a word three times, the word list contain words that are either **monosyllabic** or **disyllabic**.

### To avoid the affect of stress, only the stressed syllable is considered in every disyllabic word.

### In total, 25 words, containing 11 vowels of Kazakh. **Pratt** was used for segmenting and labelling; **Python** for extracting formants; and **R** for the rest.
